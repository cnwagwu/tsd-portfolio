## Original OECD data

## Regdesign #1
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/3723120" data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/3723120/embed" aria-label=""><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

In this redesign, I used a "chart of lines" approach. This made it so each country's ratio's were clearly visible. It also provided a clear platform for comparison. Instead of simply drawing the readers eyes to countries with the highest or smallest Debt-to-GDP ratios, I created a level playing field for each country to be compared against others in unique ways. Not every country's expereince with debt and GDP is synonmous. Therefore, a visual like this sparks dialogue among viewers who are able to draw unique insights from each of these countries. 

## Redesign #2
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-heatmap" data-src="visualisation/3723276" data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/3723276/embed" aria-label=""><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

This is definitely a different perspective than the one demonstrated from the first redesign and the original visual. A heat map with sequential coloring is able to highlight very clearly conditions on a scale of better to worse. The reader does not need to make a judgement based on the numerical values whether the the ratio is good or bad. The sequential coloring provides an opportunity for the viewer to see over time how countries have managed their ratio. It also conveys that darker colors me than the country must be experiencing a higher GDP ratio, which is often seen as a worse condition. Lastly, the heat map also provides a clear baseline for the viewer to draw comparisons. Unlike the first redesign, this design is much simpler and makes the point much faster much like the original design. However, it balances the elements of the first redesign by showing trends over time and allowing the viewer to make comprehensive comparisons.
