# Critique By Design

As someone interested in environmental justice, I wanted to pick a graph that explored information that I would be interested in. I found this paper titled "Inequity in consumption of goods and services adds to racial–ethnic disparities in air pollution exposure." In short, the paper included a figure detailing PM2.5 exposure by race, with PM source breakdowns.

It's clear that the researchers spent a ton of time and effort in trying to synethesize this data. Having done research in the past, I know the feeling of wanting to pack everything into one visual. Off the bat, it was incredibly hard to figure out the narrative they were trying to share with their audience. I had difficulty understanding the relationship between the who different column groupings. However, what did standout to me was the fact that Blacks were more likely to be exposed to higher concentrations of air pollution than whites. That was a huge finding! Throughout this process, I thought about how I could make that part of the information more clear. 

## Observations
### Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile

I completed this profile assessment to guage opportunities for me to complete this critique by design. 

**Usefulness:** This chart is very useful, because it highlights the racial differences in PM emission and exposures by contributing industry. However, it has a TON of information packed in one visual. It has a lot of information about where the levels of PM exposure is coming from, by sector and by category.
**Completeness:** This is visual lies right in between all relevant and no relevant data. Does the viewer need to know all of these different layers at once? That is the real question hear as the context, targets, and measures of the norm are all jumbled together.
**Perceptibility:** This visual is definitely on the edge of unclear and difficult. It forces the viewer to take in so much information related to the color of the bars, the level of the bars, and the cross-interaction between the two main bar categories.
**Truthfulness:** The data is definitely reliable and was part of a study focusing on racial disparities when it comes to air pollution exposure and emission.
**Intuitiveness:** The data visualization is NOT clear to understand as it deals with unfamiliar information in a very overwhelming way.
**Aesthetics:** This is really ugly, in my opinion. It's really dense and hard to decipher. The fact that the information is unfamiliar and the information is crowded makes it hard for me to appreciate this graphic.
**Engagement:** I think this visual distracts from the data at hand given that there's so much data to work with... It's hard to derive the overarching theme or messaged intended to be conveyed from this visual.

### Key Observations

**What Worked Well:** The racial groups, the breakdowns by industry and the caused versus exposure columns stood out to me. The division of the racial groups worked very well and so did the distinction between caused and exposed PM2.5. I would definitely advise that the stacked bar charts not be as stacked as they were. It was really dense and hard to differentiate between different categories and how I was meant to interpret such differences. 
**Primary Audience:** The primary audience are likely environmental health specialists, public policymakers, and other environmental researchers. I think this visualization is not that great at reaching that audience considering that they are likely people with the least amount of time to dive deep into charts. They would definitely gain from data visualizations that immediately grab their attention and are clear and straight to the point. There's too much going on for it to be helpful in guiding their decision-making or analysis processes. 
**Final Thoughts:** The primary audience are likely environmental health specialists, public policymakers, and other environmental researchers. I think this visualization is not that great at reaching that audience considering that they are likely people with the least amount of time to dive deep into charts. They would definitely gain from data visualizations that immediately grab their attention and are clear and straight to the point. There's too much going on for it to be helpful in guiding their decision-making or analysis processes. 

## Wireframe
### Initial Redesign 

My thought process for creating this redesign was to try and take a very high level approach to understanding the data. I thought during this first attempt it was important to capture overarching causation and exposure concentrations, excluding the PM source breakdowns as articulated in the original image. I created this in Infogram, which was a tool that definitely gave me the flexibility to do a barebones wireframe for what information it would important to highlight. 

<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="7f075e0c-e3ee-4801-9bf5-6246d42408bf" data-type="interactive" data-title="Bar Stacked Chart"></div><script>!function(e,i,n,s){var t="InfogramEmbeds",d=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if(window[t]&&window[t].initialized)window[t].process&&window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement("script");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async");</script><div style="padding:8px 0;font-family:Arial!important;font-size:13px!important;line-height:15px!important;text-align:center;border-top:1px solid #dadada;margin:0 30px"><a href="https://infogram.com/7f075e0c-e3ee-4801-9bf5-6246d42408bf" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank">Bar Stacked Chart</a><br><a href="https://infogram.com" style="color:#989898!important;text-decoration:none!important;" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Infogram</a></div>

### User Research Findings

For this wireframe's design critique, I surveyed two users. Please find the questions asked and their responses below:

**User 1:**
- Can you tell me what you think this is?
    - The chart is about diversity of exposures across racial groups. It also may show which of the diverse groups are more likely to be exposed than others.
- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
    - That whites are less likely to be exposed than Blacks or Hispanics.
    - The red shows me that Whites are more likely
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
    - Trying to differentiate between the red and the green. If the black people are more exposed (looking at the green) then why is it that the whites when it comes to cause seem to have a much higher rate of causation?
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
    - Environmentalists, Policymakers, and the Public
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
    - Where is this emissions coming from? Is this something that occurs throughout the year? Or just in a given time period?
    - When reading graphs, I like pie charts or line graphs to represent this type of information.
    
**User 2:**
- Can you tell me what you think this is?
- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
    - No I did not understand it right away.
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
    - You can have contaminants in an area, doesn't mean that it's caused by a particular group. Yes, their decisions or policy may have led to that, but not necessary be the predominant cause. This graph doesn't show that. 
    - Some part of it definitely has to do with the economy: People may only be able to afford areas that are contaminated and so they move in there.
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
    - Blacks — It's showcasing them as marginalized in this context?
    - This visual may cause racial tension — Tension isn't a good thing. In some cases, it can be productive, in others it may not. Sometimes, people don't make changes until you push them to the wall.
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
    - Vertical, bar charts normally read up down left to right. Get a better view and add a bar at the top. Like an arrow bar to give you the actual range of certain STD of these data points.
    
**Key Findings:**
- Although the graph is lighter than the previous one, the users had difficulty understanding the findings presented
- The color scheme choices were misleading 
- The little context of the problem made it harder to draw inferences

## Redesign 

In this redesign, I tried a different approach where I was intentionally more thorough in my design choices. Instead of focusing on caused versus exposued PM2.5 concentrations, I only focused on the PM2.5 Exposure concentrations by race. This made it easier for me to then opt for a stacked chart to provide more context to where these numbers were coming from. It also made it easier for the reader to grasp the relationship between racial groups and PM2.5 Exposure Levels.
