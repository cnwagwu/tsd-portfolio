This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About me
Hello there! I'm Chizo (she/hers) and I am a second-year Masters of Public Policy and Management student at CMU's Heinz College of Public Policy and Information Systems. I am super interested in exploring the intersection between tech, policy, and design. This summer, I had the chance to do just that as a Policy Innovation Lab Fellow. My team and I worked to propose and lay the framework for a digital service product aimed at attracting green bond investors to the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. Prior to Heinz, I was a Fulbright Student Researcher in Lagos, Nigeria for nine months doing reserch on drug use attitudes among youth in Lagos. I attended Syracuse University where I earned a degree in Policy Studies and Neuroscience. 

Once I graduate, I really want to continue the work that I did during the fellowship -- basically anything related to public interest tech! It's been really exciting and eye-opening to learn about how impactful this field could be and already is. 

Outside of class and work, I'm a budding gardnener and embroiderer. I'm always open to new ideas and learning new techniques :-)

# What I hope to learn
In this information age, data presentation and communication plays a huge role. I think it's important that data visualizations cater to their users needs, appeals to their ways of processing information, and values. I also think it's important that data can be represented in ways that are accessible to wider audiences. These are skills I hope to develop throughout this course. I am also eager to explore how to use data to inspire action.
