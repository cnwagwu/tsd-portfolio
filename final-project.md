# Final Project

## Part 1

### Outline
High-level Overivew: Bicycling is becoming an increasingly attractive mode of transport, considering its perceived low-cost, accessibility, and appeal to those who care about climate change. However, the racial and socioeconomic disparities that exist within bicycling are not often discussed. 
- Reader takeaways: As a reader, I want everyone in my community to have access to cycling so that that everyone in my community has an opportunity to join this movement for fighting climate change and rethinking transportation. 

**Story Map**
 - Personal Connection:
    - Before I could drive a car, I biked. It was the ultimate source of freedom. I thought this would be a great opportunity to talk about how something that is such a huge part of my identity also harbors serious inequities and access restrictions that are not often discussed. The following outline is what I initially planned to help me map out the story that I was interested in telling. This ended up being iterated upon considering that at the time I didn't yet have concrete data sources to refer to yet and was going mostly based off the literature that I reviewed prior to this exercise. 
 - Set up: 
   - Biking industry is emerging, positive for climate changes
 - Conflict:
    - Biking typically part of gentrification and displacement efforts
    - Inequities in the socioeconomic status of those who bike
    - Blacks are five times as likely to be stopped by police while biking (Pulled form an article I read)
  - Resolution:
    - Everyone enjoys equitable access to join biking community and not experience fear of policing due to biking while black. 
    - Long-term community oriented and led biking programs (educational workshops, repairs, planning)
    - Advocate against racial profiling by residents and police while biking
### Initial Sketches
- In this exercise, I used Balsamiq to create a wireframe of how I would want this storyboard to be demonstrated in Shorthand, which I will get into later. I drafted out how the beginning page would be and how these events would weave into the call to action. I also added small descriptions of how I plan on integrating this information.

### Data Sources
- This is a collection of all the data sources that I used for my initial sketches. I am definitely a bit worried about how simplistic my data is. I think what I am excited to do is transform each of these into very direct, interactive, and informative pieces that weave the narrative I am trying to tell about biking together. 
  - Ethnic Background, Bikeshare Members and All Regional Employees: Breakdown of Bikeshare member ethnicities versus the employees. I plan on doing a unit chart where the user would be able to contrast the percentage of white and non-white bikeshare riders themselves, by emphasizing how huge this gap is other than simply showing a bar chart. From [Capital Bikeshare Ethnic Background - Bikeshare Members and All Regional Employees](https://d21xlh2maitm24.cloudfront.net/wdc/Capital-Bikeshare_2016MemberSurvey_Final-Report.pdf?mtime=20170303165531).   [Excel File](https://github.com/cnwagwu/tsd-portfolio/blob/master/ITDP%20High%20Shift%20Savings.xlsx). 
  - Philadephia Pandemic Ridership Increase: Automated Bike Counters recorded 463% spike in Cyclists on Kelly Drive Trail from March 1 to March 18 2020 compared to the same period last year. I plan on doing a unit chart that displays how big of a difference that is when such a spike occured. This is an effort to show how much biking has grown in the US in just the past few months. From [Energy News Article](https://energynews.us/2020/04/16/west/the-pandemic-is-fueling-a-biking-boom-will-it-last/). [Excel File.](https://github.com/cnwagwu/tsd-portfolio/blob/master/Philadelphia%20Kelly%20Drive%20Trail.xlsx)
  - 11% Carbon Reduction: Scientists Estimate a 11% reduction in CO2 if we at least see a 20% increase in bicycling! I plan on doing a "before" and "after" layered pie chart to be able to visually tell the story of how much impact an action like that could make in terms of carbon emissions. From [Institute for Transportation and Development Policy](https://www.itdp.org/2015/11/12/a-global-high-shift-cycling-scenario/). [Excel file](https://github.com/cnwagwu/tsd-portfolio/blob/master/ITDP%20High%20Shift%20Savings.xlsx).
  - % of Traffic Stops: Data based on specific datasets from Washington and New Orleans. I plan on doing a layered pie chart to demonstrate these discrepancies. Taken from article highlighting black cyclists traffic stops in [Bicycling.com](https://www.bicycling.com/culture/a33383540/cycling-while-black-police/).  [Excel file](https://github.com/cnwagwu/tsd-portfolio/blob/master/%25%20of%20Traffic%20Stops%20New%20Orleans%20and%20Washington.xlsx).
  - Access Pass Membership: This data shows how this program intended to expand access to low-income people of color in Philly to the rideshare program. The point is to emphasize how the representation compares among those specific Access pass holders and the addded benefit of diversifying the city's cohort of traditional bikers. This was taken from [BetterBikeshare](https://betterbikeshare.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1-pager-access-pass-12_18_18.pdf). [Excel file](https://github.com/cnwagwu/tsd-portfolio/blob/master/Access%20Pass%20Members%20Philly.xlsx)
  
  
### Method and Medium

![Wireframe](https://github.com/cnwagwu/tsd-portfolio/blob/master/Balsamiq%20Wireframe%201.png)

- As detailed above, I plan to use shorthand for my presentation and tablaeu for some of the data visualizations. I would like to explore how I can use tablaeu to create unit charts to show some clear comparisons. I also plan on using Figma to design some more picture/illustration oriented data visualizations that would be easier to tell a story that simple interactive charts. I believe that most of my visuals will be better served and unique if they are more "artistic" and message oriented instead of simply showing a bunch of bar charts and numerical comparisons. I think that using these mediums to emphasize these disparities is important and will actually serve the message I am trying to tell well. I am open to getting more feedback on other data sources or data visualization types that could enrich the story that I am trying to tell.
- One thing that I am interested in working on as part of using this medium is ensuring that the story flows into the action item that I am presenting. I am definitely in the process of more clearly defining my action item. So far, I've gotten some ideas about directing the user to a specific petition or directing them to a certain action. I am eager to use Shorthand's embed features to create forms or interactive checklists that users can engage with following the presentation of all this information.
- As it goes for the method for presenting this information, I plan on ensuring that redundancy is not also part of this approach. I plan on exploring how I can incorporate other visual storytelling methods like phtoography and video to be able to capture the story I am trying to tell. 

## Part 2

This quite honestly was the most challenging exercise, or so I thought.  Doing this part helped me conceptualize how effective I was at telling the story that I was trying to tell. Throughout this section you will be able to preview some of th raw feedback I received from the exercise of wireframing and storyboarding from the points that I highlighted in Part 1. 

### Wireframes and Storyboard 
Access the shorthand story [here](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/biking-is-great--but-for-whom-/index.html)
I tried to build off the wireframe that I built for the Part 1 exercise and really worked on building out my initial sketches to capture the points that I intended on making. 

#### User Research Protocol
- **Target Audience:** Individuals that care about climate change, transportation justice, and equity. I also hope to rope in folks that consider themselves cyclists to some degree. I believe these are users who all have high potential to heed the call to action and share this information with their respective communities to directly make impact in these areas.
- **Approach to identifying representative individuals:** I plan on using my personal networks, specifically those at Heinz and those within my residential community to gauge the effectiveness and relevance of my visualizations. I will especially place emphasis on reaching out to individuals with who have vocalized their concern about the environment or about transportation justice and equity to me.

**User Feedback**
3. I liked that you added your own personal story to it. It made me connect to it more and care more. I liked that you addressed the reader. 

#### Carbon Emissions

![CO2P2](https://github.com/cnwagwu/tsd-portfolio/blob/master/co2%20part2.JPG)

**User Feedback**
- What do you take away from this visualization? What are you seeing here?
  1. Lot of smoke, this is probably in a big city. The Megatonnes is highlighted and big. This is the reduction goal that you have for this scenario. 
  2. From mobile in portrait mode, you cannot read the text.  The text in the infographic is completely cut off. Also cut off on the second half. 
  3. No comment
- Can you identify what is a worse outcome and which is a better outcome based on the information from the visualization?
  1. 
  2. 
  3. No Comment
- What might you do differently to change this visualization? What would you add, change, or remove?
  1. Color - the off-white. I see the problem as the solution. Different shading by color could help!
  2. 
  3. It would be interesting know how biking while living in an urban area differs than living in suburbs. 

#### Pandemic Increase

![PandemicIncrease](https://github.com/cnwagwu/tsd-portfolio/blob/master/Pandemic%20Increase%20Cycling.png)


**User Feedback**
- What do you take away from this visualization? What are you seeing here?
  1. Huge spike in cycling from 2019-2020. See basically a 500-600% increase. The very top bicycle looks like to corresponds to 500 something. Surprised its 471. 
  2. In 2019 there was 0%???? in 2020 there were 500 something percent?? This isn't scaled right.  The substitle about the comparison isn't super clear. 
  3. This one I see the difference in bike riding between 2019 and 2020 but I’m confused what it means. Is it saying that 0% of people rode bike an in 2019?
- Can you identify what is a worse outcome and which is a better outcome based on the information from the visualization?
  1. Draw a line to make it clear where the the 471% is. Put the year at the top, switch. You have to scroll all the way down to see the year. Can't tell the graph. 
  2. In the absence of the raw numbers, I am not sure how to convey that growth. 
  3. Love the bikes. 
- What might you do differently to change this visualization? What would you add, change, or remove?
  1.
  2. I would have the comparison on the X-Axis under the years. Not in the subtitle. Also data labels.
  3. Also maybe say something about why you used the this trail specifically as an example. Yeah it’s not very clear just from the graph. 

#### Capital Bikeshare Workers

**User Feedback**
- What do you take away from this visualization? What are you seeing here?
  1. Not clear from the get go which type of orientation you're supposed to look at! Liked the POC grouping! Looks really good! 
  2. I've never seen this before! That's pretty cool! I get that the people of color bubble is about the same as the white. The label of people of color and white isn't super clear phrasing. 
  3. I don’t know if this is relevant but I don’t know what the rideshare program is. This is super cool but hard to figure out how to use. 
- What might you do differently to change this visualization? What would you add, change, or remove?
  1.Put percentage so it's clear. My attention isn;t going to the subtittle. Grouping of people of color isn't working. The color scheme isn't super clear. Not very clear to see that they're working more. Change the color. POC must be a darker color. 
  2. Compare by not very informative. Say roughly 55%. The subtitle. Detail the ride program. Make it Not much of a lead up to why we're talking about rideshare. 
  3. Like maybe give instructions on how to navigate this.

**User Feedback**: Not availabe, as not rendering in Shorthand demo.

**User Feedback**
- What do you take away from this visualization? What are you seeing here?
  1. That's scary. Black are more likely to be topped by whites. 
  2. Get that the blue is the percent of cycling stops. 
  3. No comment
- What might you do differently to change this visualization? What would you add, change, or remove?
  1. Change the color to make it more apparent. Need data labels. Also the circle feels flat. I would have been more struck by this graph that showed that discrepancy. Looking at the circle it's hard to see that black cyclists make up 87.7% of all cyclist stops. 
  2. Maybe having the percentages labeled would be nice. It would be good to include a breakdown of the cyclist population. It's obviously disproportionate. It doesn't say the percentage of cyclists that are black versus white versus other. What are these outer and inner rings? Definitely need to make sure you can highlight the blue piece. You miss out on it if you don't interact with it right away. 
  3. 

#### Building Blocks

- What might you do differently to change this visualization? What would you add, change, or remove?
  1. Would love for this to be horizontal. Make a road. Trying to go from point A to point B. Start as something as simply as design for safety. And actually put it in reverse order. 
  2. I liked the visual. It is very cute and pleasing to the eye. It needs more explanation and context. 
  3. No comment

#### Access Pass

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-survey" data-src="visualisation/3945343" data-url="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/3945343/embed" aria-label=""><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

**User Feedback**
- What do you take away from this visualization? What are you seeing here?
  1. The other members is too big and isn't telling me a lot. The access members part is actually helping me making a comparison. I guess maybe because I'm not familiar. I need a lot more context for this program. No real point of comparison to the rest of the members. The big blob isn't telling me a lot. 
  2. It feels like the other members blob is overshadowing this other stuff. It's a big unlabeled blob. 
  3. No comment.
 
- What might you do differently to change this visualization? What would you add, change, or remove?
  1. I'm not sure what I would change. I look at this ball and it doesn't strike me. Can you add more legends? It feels unfinished. I can't distinguish between the different levels.  — Maybe try looking for a more detailed data set?
  2. Limit the graphic to just the access pass members. Can't really see the other interesting points. The other members is literally just there. 
  3. Clarify what is an Acess Pass member

#### Entire Story Debrief
- What did you take away from this story?
 1. Even with something as cycling, black people specifically are disadvantaged. If there were programs like the access program, maybe that's not enough. That's why we need cycling companies to divest from the police. How are cycling companies being collaborative in the first place? Is there a way to demonstrate that? 
 2. I understand the connection between the disproportionate targeting of black cyclists by the police and encouraging them to divest from the police. The rideshare information I do not know how to place that in this narrative. Overall, this would benefit from some accompanied text explanation and guided analysis of what the reader needs to take away.
 3. What I took away from the story is that Black cyclists are more likely to be stopped and that biking isn't accessible to them as white people. I definitely didn't know how much cops stop black people on bikes. 

- Do you believe this data gave you the foundation to inspire action in someway?
  1. It didn't inspire me to go out there and do something but I can sign a petition definitely being more aware of this. 87 traffic stops stuck with him!!! 
- If this is a topic that is new to you, what did you find helpful? What would you have liked to know to help inform your call to action?
  1. The divesting from the police really. 
  2. I think that making a more explicit connection between what you want environmentalist types to take away from this. It really depends on the target audience. If you are talking to urbanite white cyclists who are cycling to reduce their carbon footprint, explaining the the narrative that they buy into would go a long way. Talk about how how people of color ride bikes for all sorts of reasons. These are the things that we need to do to make cycling and rideshare options are viable options for people of color specifically. That will help talk about why you're talking about cycling and ridesharing. Put the cycling and ridesharing together. Really EXPLAIN how you're tying ridesharing and cycling together. 
  3. It seems there's a correlation between income disparity and biking. I would highlight that. I'd be interested in knowing how biking while living in an urban area differes than living in the suburbs. The call to action is clear but your story is about so much more than just cops. It didn't seem like you were prepping the reader to specifically care about cops making traffic stops. 
  

#### Key Takeaways from User Research
This feedback was extraordinarily helpful. As someone who has been so focused on simply figuring our how to visualize the data, the user feedback really brought me back to Earth in figuring out how I should tell this story. Much of the feedback discussed how the visuals as they are now are not enough context to really tell the story that I was trying to tell. I realized in the process also of making these visualizations that there is simply a lot that I could touch on with this topic, however my strength is really making this story a bit more personal. This week I plan on really fleshing that out as well as trying to be more selective in the data that I chose to present this narrative. 

**Based on the feedback, I plan on taking the following steps:**
- Re-evaluate my data choices: Not all the visualizations, especially the CO2 Emissions infographic and the capital rideshare (employees) were as powerful as I thought they would be. I realize that I need to really spell out their connection betweenn my story and the rest of the visualizations. Otherwise, their context and relevance gets lost to the user.
 - Carbon Emissions: The connection is simply not clear between the story that I am trying to tell and this data. It is likely that I will need to replace this with data that ties into the more personal narrative that I start out telling if it is to come at the beginning.
 - Pandemic Increase: Not a very clear graph at all. It needs to be manipulated to be very straightforward. It might be better to simply have a callout that talks about the growth instead of having the user figure out what that growth is themselves.
 - Capital Rideshare Visuals: Simply wasn't a whole lot of context for these visuals in udnerstanding where rideshare fits into the grand scheme of cycling disparities. Had my second visual actually rendered, I might have gotten more positive feedback. However, that was not the case. I will definitely need to find suporting data to highlight the relevance of rideshare disparity data to get around having to explain in lengthy words what rideshare's connection to cycling is. 
 - Building Blocks: This visuals purpose wasn't super clear to me the purpose that it would serve. However, I received a ton of positive feedback about its' aesthetic and the feedback seemed to indicate that more context was simply necessary for how this graphic will set the stage for this story of cycling, access, and equity. 
 - Access Pass: Very similar feedback across the board whichw as that Access Pass members needed to be very clearly defined. Everyone also agreed that even highlighting the other members was distracting. This was surprising to me, but makes sense given the lack of data that I do have for this group of other members. 
- Create a distinct color palette: My trial users had a hard time following where their attention needed to be going. I wasn't concious of this and didn't think when making this visual that it would be much of problem. This would have been helpful to go over as part of my moodboarding exercise. Definitely something I plan on dabbling with this coming week to ensure that my message remains consistent. 
- Spell out the connections: Given it was my first time working in Shorthand, I definitely found the animations and different section styles a bit intimidating. This week I plan on really fleshing out zones that are appropriate for additional text and to make sure that my visuals get straight to the point. Many found the interactivity in some floursh animations to be more distracting than informative, contrary to my initial thoughts. 

## Part 3

### Understanding my audience
- The intended audience for my final data story became even more narrowed that what I originally thought it to be. I would say that the feedback from the in-class critique session was the most helpful. Instead of touching on the climate piece that I originally planned on exploring, I decided to hone in on the racial disparities that I was trying illustrate. This was particularly motivated by the fact that there was little data to support the insights on climate change that I was trying to make.
- My ultimate intended became those that were concerned about social justice and/or transportation equity. Such individuals value clear call to actions and in light of much of the data in this space as it relates to biking being mostly anecdotal or hard to find, I needed to be very clear about what outcome these data findings are intended to support. I decided to completely remove my initial call to action because it was clear that my existing data visualizations did not support this call to action clearly. Instead I went back to the literature to see if there were other reports that could clearly define a call to action that aligned with my current insights.
- I found a biking equity report that basically made clear that much of this data around disparities in biking supported work to ensure that communities of color had access to protected bike lanes. By using this as my light post, I was able to easily cut out data visualizations that no longer made sense for the story I needed to tell. I think part of this process was that the story I wanted to tell needed to still be aligned with what most experts are already advocating for and not solely being based on my users desires and my initial inquiries.

### Reflecting on my design decisions
- Navigating these design decisions was difficult to say the least. Part of this was that already so much of the data that I had did not necessarily neatly fit into a narrative that I was able to clearly envision. I really enjoyed the process of having several opportunities to question and iterate on my initial design decisions by getting feedback from my peers and my intended audience. It definitely helped me realize that there are aspects of my design thought process that aren't easily understood by everyone.
- One thing I really appreciated as part of this process was the chance to go back in the data and see which data actually made sense to include in my story. I am glad I had the chance to remove some the data around emissions and other rideshare programs. Getting to the point fast is really important in contexts such as Shorthand, where I won't be there to guide the reader. Having that in mind really helped me curate a story that was a lot more direct and true to the message that I wanted to convey.
