# Final Project

## Part 1

### Outline
Story Map
 - Personal Connection:
    - Before I could drive a car, I biked. It was the ultimate source of freedom. I thought this would be a great opportunity to talk about how something that is such a huge part of my identity also harbors serious inequities and access restrictions that are not often discussed. The following outline is what I initially planned to help me map out the story that I was interested in telling. This ended up being iterated upon considering that at the time I didn't yet have concrete data sources to refer to yet and was going mostly based off the literature that I reviewed prior to this exercise. 
 - Set up: 
   - Biking industry is emerging, positive for climate changes
 - Conflict:
    - Biking typically part of gentrification and displacement efforts
    - Inequities in the socioeconomic status of those who bike
    - Blacks are five times as likely to be stopped by police while biking (Pulled form an article I read)
  - Resolution:
    - Everyone enjoys equitable access to join biking community and not experience fear of policing due to biking while black. 
    - Long-term community oriented and led biking programs (educational workshops, repairs, planning)
    - Advocate against racial profiling by residents and police while biking
### Initial Sketches
- In this exercise, I used Balsamiq to create a wireframe of how I would want this storyboard to be demonstrated in Shorthand, which I will get into later. I drafted out how the beginning page would be and how these events would weave into the call to action. I also added small descriptions of how I plan on integrating this information.

### Data Sources
- This is a collection of all the data sources that I used for my initial sketches. I am definitely a bit worried about how simplistic my data is. I think what I am excited to do is transform each of these into very direct, interactive, and informative pieces that weave the narrative I am trying to tell about biking together. 
  - Ethnic Background, Bikeshare Members and All Regional Employees: Breakdown of Bikeshare member ethnicities versus the employees. I plan on doing a unit chart where the user would be able to contrast the percentage of white and non-white bikeshare riders themselves, by emphasizing how huge this gap is other than simply showing a bar chart. From [Capital Bikeshare Ethnic Background - Bikeshare Members and All Regional Employees](https://d21xlh2maitm24.cloudfront.net/wdc/Capital-Bikeshare_2016MemberSurvey_Final-Report.pdf?mtime=20170303165531).   [Excel File](https://github.com/cnwagwu/tsd-portfolio/blob/master/ITDP%20High%20Shift%20Savings.xlsx). 
  - Philadephia Pandemic Ridership Increase: Automated Bike Counters recorded 463% spike in Cyclists on Kelly Drive Trail from March 1 to March 18 2020 compared to the same period last year. I plan on doing a unit chart that displays how big of a difference that is when such a spike occured. This is an effort to show how much biking has grown in the US in just the past few months. From [Energy News Article](https://energynews.us/2020/04/16/west/the-pandemic-is-fueling-a-biking-boom-will-it-last/). [Excel File.](
  - 11% Carbon Reduction: Scientists Estimate a 11% reduction in CO2 if we at least see a 20% increase in bicycling! I plan on doing a "before" and "after" layered pie chart to be able to visually tell the story of how much impact an action like that could make in terms of carbon emissions. From [Institute for Transportation and Development Policy](https://www.itdp.org/2015/11/12/a-global-high-shift-cycling-scenario/). [Excel file](https://github.com/cnwagwu/tsd-portfolio/blob/master/ITDP%20High%20Shift%20Savings.xlsx).
  - % of Traffic Stops: Data based on specific datasets from Washington and New Orleans. I plan on doing a layered pie chart to demonstrate these discrepancies. Taken from article highlighting black cyclists traffic stops in [Bicycling.com](https://www.bicycling.com/culture/a33383540/cycling-while-black-police/).  [Excel file](https://github.com/cnwagwu/tsd-portfolio/blob/master/%25%20of%20Traffic%20Stops%20New%20Orleans%20and%20Washington.xlsx).
  - Access Pass Membership: This data shows how this program intended to expand access to low-income people of color in Philly to the rideshare program. The point is to emphasize how the representation compares among those specific Access pass holders and the addded benefit of diversifying the city's cohort of traditional bikers. This was taken from [BetterBikeshare](https://betterbikeshare.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1-pager-access-pass-12_18_18.pdf).

### Method and Medium

- As detailed above, I plan to use shorthand for my presentation and tablaeu for some of the data visualizations. I would like to explore how I can use tablaeu to create unit charts to show some clear comparisons. I also plan on using Figma to design some more picture/illustration oriented data visualizations that would be easier to tell a story that simple interactive charts. I am open to getting more feedback on other data sources or data visualization types that could enrich the story that I am trying to tell.
